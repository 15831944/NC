<h1>Welcome to NCAlgebra</h1>

<h2>Downloading</h2>

<p>Thanks for downloading NCAlgebra.</p>

<p>You can download the lastest version of NCAlgebra from:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.math.ucsd.edu/~ncalg">www.math.ucsd.edu/~ncalg</a></p>

<h2>Unpacking</h2>

<p>
  We provide the files NCAlgebra.zip and a NCAlgebra.tgz, which
  contain the exact same files in different compact formats. PC and
  Mac people might prefer to download the NCAlgebra.zip file, while
  Unix people may like the NCAlgebra.tgz file better. Unpacking any of
  these files will create a directory 'NC' which contains all the
  files necessary to run NCAlgebra.
</p>

<h3>If you downloaded the NCAlgebra.zip file:</h3>

<p>
  Use your favorite zip utility to unpack the file NCAlgebra.zip in
  your favorite location.
</p>

<h3>If you downloaded the NCAlgebra.tgz file:</h3>

<p>
  You can uncompress the file using your favorite zip utility or using
  the command line:
</p>

<pre>
  tar xvzf NCAlgebra.tgz
</pre>

<p>
  If your tar version does not support zip files you may have to do it
  in two steps:
</p>

<pre>
  gunzip NCAlgebra.tgz
  tar xvf NCAlgebra.tar
</pre>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>
  All that is needed for NCAlgebra to run is that its top directory,
  the 'NC' directory, be on Mathematica's search path. If you are on a
  unix flavored machine (Solaris, Linux, Mac OSX) then unpacking in
  your home directory (~) is all you need to do. You may want to try
  to run NCAlgebra as explained in the next section to see if that
  works.
</p>

<p>
  If you want to put the files someplace else, all you need to do is to
  modify Mathematica's search path. You can do this in one of two
  ways:
</p>

<h3>If you are experienced with Mathematica:</h3>

<p>
  Edit your init.m file to add the name of the directory which
  contains the 'NC' folder to the Mathematica variable $Path.
</p>

<h3>Or</h3>

<p>
  You can use our <b>InstallNCAlgebra.nb</b> notebook to automagically set up
  the Mathematica's $Path variable. Open this notebook and follow the
  directions which are found there.
</p>

<h2>Running NCAlgebra</h2>

<p>
  In Mathematica (notebook or text interface), type
</p>

<pre>
  << NC`
</pre>

<p>
  If this fails, your installation has problems (check out previous
  section). If your installation is succesful you will see a message
  like:
</p>

<pre>
  You are using the version of NCAlgebra which is found in:
    /your_home_directory/NC.
  You can now use "<< NCAlgebra`" to load NCAlgebra or "<< NCGB`" to load NCGB.
</pre>

<p>
  Just type 
</p>

<pre>
  << NCAlgebra`
</pre>

<p>
  to load NCAlgebra, or
</p>

<pre>
  << NCGB`
</pre>

<p>
  to load NCAlgebra and NCGB.
</p>

<h2>Now what?</h2>

<p>
  Extensive documentation is found in the directory DOCUMENTATION.
</p>

<p>
  If you're reading this off the web or from your original NC
  distribution you can click here to open a pdf version of
  the <a href="DOCUMENTATION/DOCUMENT.pdf">User's Manual (PDF)</a> or
  browse the html
  version of the <a href="DOCUMENTATION/html/NCBIGDOC.html">User's Manual
  (HTML)</a>.
</p>

<p>
  You may want to try some of the several demo files in the directory
  DEMOS after you install NCAlgebra.
</p>

<p>
  You can also run some tests to see if things are working fine.
</p>

<h2>Testing</h2>

<p>
  Type 
</p>

<pre>
  << NCTEST
</pre>

<p>
  to test NCAlgebra. Type 
</p>

<pre>
  << NCGBTEST
</pre>

<p>
  to test NCGB. We recommend that you restart the kernel before and
  after running each test set.
</p>

<h2>Reporting Bugs</h2>

<p>
  Please report any bug or your extraordinarily pleasant experience
  with NCAlgebra by
  email <a href="mailto:ncalg@math.ucsd.edu">ncalg@math.ucsd.edu</a>

<p>
  Thanks,

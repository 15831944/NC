BeginCommuteEverything[expr] sets all symbols appearing in expr as commutative so that the resulting expression contains only commutative products or inverses. It issues messages warning about which symbols have been affected.

EndCommuteEverything[] restores the symbols noncommutative behaviour.

BeginCommuteEverything answers the question _what does it sound like?_

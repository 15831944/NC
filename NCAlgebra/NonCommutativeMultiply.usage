(* Id *)
Id::usage = "\
Id is noncommutative multiplicative identity. Actually Id is now set equal 1.";

co[x] is the conjugate of x. It is a linear involution.

See also: aj.";

(* CommutativeQ *)
CommutativeQ::usage = "\
CommutativeQ[x] is _True_ if x is commutative (the default), and _False_ if x is noncommutative.

See also: SetCommutative, SetNonCommutative.";

NonCommutativeQ[x] is equal to Not[CommutativeQ[x]].

See CommutativeQ.";

Commutative[x] makes the noncommutative _Symbol_ x behave as if it were commutative.

(* CommuteEverything *)
CommuteEverything::usage = "\
CommuteEverything answers the question \"what does it sound like?\".

CommuteEverything[expr] replaces all noncommutative symbols in expr by its commutative self using Commutative so that the resulting expression contains only commutative products or inverses.

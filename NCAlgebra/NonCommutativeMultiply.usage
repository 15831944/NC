(* NonCommutativeQ *)
NonCommutativeQ::usage = "\
NonCommutativeQ[expr] is equal to Not[CommutativeQ[expr]].

See also: CommutativeQ.";

inv::usage = "\
inv[expr] is the 2-sided inverse of expression expr.";

(* CommutativeQ *)
CommutativeQ::usage = "\
CommutativeQ[expr] is _True_ if expression expr is commutative (the default), and _False_ if expr is noncommutative.

See also: SetCommutative, SetNonCommutative.";

SetNonCommutative::usage = "\
SetNonCommutative[a,b,c,...] sets all the _Symbols_ a, b, c, ... to be noncommutative.

tp[expr] is the tranpose of expression expr. It is a linear involution.

(* CommuteEverything *)
CommuteEverything::usage = "\
CommuteEverything answers the question \"what does it sound like?\".

CommuteEverything[expr] replaces all noncommutative symbols in expr by its commutative self using Commutative so that the resulting expression contains only commutative products or inverses.

Id is noncommutative multiplicative identity. Actually Id is now set equal 1.";

EndCommuteEverything[expr] restores noncommutative behaviour to symbols affected by BeginCommuteEverything.

co[expr] is the conjugate of expression expr. It is a linear involution.

tp[expr] is the tranpose of expression expr. It is a linear involution.

Id is noncommutative multiplicative identity. Actually Id is now set equal 1.";

inv[expr] is the 2-sided inverse of expression expr.

If Options[inv, Distrubute] is False (the default) then

ExpandNonCommutativeMultiply[expr] expands out **s in expr.

For example

    a**b+a**c.

Its aliases are NCE, and NCExpand.";

(* BeginCommuteEverything *)
BeginCommuteEverything::usage = "\
BeginCommuteEverything[expr] sets all symbols appearing in expr as commutative so that the resulting expression contains only commutative products or inverses. It issues messages warning about which symbols have been affected.

EndCommuteEverything[] restores the symbols noncommutative behaviour.

BeginCommuteEverything answers the question _what does it sound like?_

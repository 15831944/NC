NCReplaceList::usage = "\
NCReplace[expr,rules] attempts to transform the entire nc expression expr by applying a rule or list of rules rules in all possible ways, and returns a list of the results obtained.

ReplaceList[expr,rules,n] gives a list of at most n results.

(* NCReplaceRepeated *)
NCReplaceRepeated::usage = "\
NCReplaceRepeated[expr,rules] repeatedly performs replacements using rule or list of rules rules until expr no longer changes.

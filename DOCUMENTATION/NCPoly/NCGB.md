## NCGB {#PackageNCGB}

This packages supports our legacy Gr√∂ebner Bases algorithm that
requires both Mathematica and auxiliary executables compiled from C++
to run. [NCGBX](#PackageNCGBX) may run slower on some medium size
problems but will succeed on large size problems which might fail
under [NCGB](#PackageNCGB).

This code has become hard to maintain and support and may be
deprecated in the future. See older versions of the NC documentation
for a complete description of its functionality.
